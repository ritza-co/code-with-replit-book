# Closing note

We have now come to the end of the series of tutorials. You have learnt the basics of the Repl.it IDE, worked with more advanced features and gone through a number of practical projects. This doesn't mean the end of fun projects, for you should now be equipped to tackle your own projects, which you can start from scratch or use the code from the tutorials as a basis.
